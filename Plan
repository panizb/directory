1. Draw an ER model for my DB and turn it into MySQL
2. Write as many use-cases as you can
3. A brief domain model (maybe in mind!)

Coding starts:
    3. Log in form (using Google API)
    4. Handling Sessions
    5. Start with classes like DB Handler, User, Contact and ... and also think about a PHP Makefile

6. Making the UI look nicer
7. Check the Standards
8. Write a composer
9. Write unit tests

10. Write a manifest
11. Vagrant up
12. Gitlab!

Doing meanwhile:
    *Testing each unit of code
    *Iterate through coding steps
    *Asking lots of questions
